This repository contains data that I use for Data Analysis and Statistic Inference
These files are:

README.md - this file contain the description of its content
Workbook4.txt - this is the file contain data.  There are 4 variable with 50K cases
These variable are:
1. Version - software identification
2. BugType - Type of changes, "bug" - a defect, or "feature" a new feature added
3. Age.Month - When did the bug found in relative to when the software 
    is released, the unit is in months and is discrete
4. Pre.Month - When did the bug found in relative to when the software
    is released.  This is similar to Age.Month, but group bug found before
	software is released to be "pre"
